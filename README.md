--[ On (mod n) Spirals ]--


Paper describing the work is in paper/modNspirals.(tex|pdf)

Code for generation of Ond and visuals, use spirals.py, triangles-*.py, hexagons-*.py in
the root directory. Quality of code design varies among the different files due to not
backporting re-writes (e.g, hexagons-spirals.py written well after spirals.py).

Visualizations are found in visual/

The rest is for storage of lesser code.
