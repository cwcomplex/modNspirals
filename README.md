modNspirals
===========

The set mod N = { 0, 1, ..., N-1 }

I want to iterate over mod N in a spiral fashion over a set of lattic
points. I define a 'square' to be achieved when the length of the sides
are equal /and/ the last value placed is N-1; that is, so an iteration
ends in a corner producing a square. In spiraling, we go clockwise.


Conj. Given N >= 2 in |N and k => 1 in |N, the k-th square will have
      upper bound on size as k*N-by-k*N and upper bound on iterations
      of mod N as k*k*N.
    
Conj. For some values of N, k*N-by-k*N, k*k*N is exact.
